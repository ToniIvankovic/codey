# Codey 🤖
This is Codey, an app designed for learning programming as a beginner. \
I developed the app as part of my master thesis and used it to test the effectiveness of gamification on student motivation.\
The app consists of two subapps - backend and frontend.\
The backend app, developed in .NET, is located in the [backend](backend) directory.\
The frontend app, developed in Flutter, is located in the [codey](codey) directory.\
The app is deployed on the following link: [https://d3l6qdq14kds7s.cloudfront.net/](https://d3l6qdq14kds7s.cloudfront.net/)\

** At this time, the app is only available in Croatian 🇭🇷
